              'Khara, she was\n'
              '   18 years old, and she did not exactly look like a '
              'mountaineer. After\n'
              '   discussing the climb, I immediately decided that Id need to '

              '   myself.\n'
              '\n'

              'Kaikoura, New\n'
              '   Zealand, in the summer of 2010.  I was wandering around with '
              'my buddy,\n'
              '   Jeff Calvert, and mentioned that while I wanted this SLR, I '
              'felt that I\n'
              '   should wait until I was really into photography.  Jeff '
              'quickly\n'

              'two-week-long\n'
              '   language exchange program in the south of France.  I '
              'absolutely LOVED\n'

              'Asia was\n'
              '   during my travels up East Coast Australia in the summer of '
              '2010.  Many\n'

              'shut the\n'

              '\n'
              '   6. The first time I realized it was all possible was on a '
              'boat in\n'
              '   Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, in the summer of 2010.  I met '
              'this kid,\n'
              '   Tuan Truong, who was originally from North Carolina.  After '
              'graduating\n'
              '   college, Tuan moved to Australia, worked on a cruise ship in '
              'the Sydney\n'
              '   Harbor, and saved up enough money to fly to New Zealand and '
              'buy a car.\n'
              '    From there, the kid was living out of this car, cooking '
              'meals on a\n'
              '   small gas stove, and doing incredible things each and every '
              'day.  He\n'
              '   did not need another person pushing him forward (and likely '
              'holding him\n'
              '   back), and did not even need a bed to sleep in every night.  '
              'All he\n'
              '   needed was some optimism, and a bit of problem solving.  This '
              'kids\n'
              '   story has stuck with me.  He is currently in Norway, leading '
              'kayak\n'

              'because\n'

              '\n'
              '   7. The first move I made towards realizing this trip was on '
              'July 20th,\n'

              'account to\n'
              '   buy those first flights.\n'
              '\n'
              '   8. The first purchase I made was on July 22nd, 2011.  The STA '
              'Travel\n'
              '   office in Arizona opened at 3:00pm EST, and I called at '
              '3:00pm EST.  I\n'

              'bike.  I\n'
              '   was sweaty.  I booked flights from Philadelphia, PA to '
              'Nairobi, Kenya;\n'

              '\n'
              '   9. The first person I told about my trip was myself.  I knew '
              'what I\n'

              '\n'
              '   1) There are several cozy hostels in town, and I cant imagine '
              'any ever\n'
              '   come close to filling up.  There is no need to book a hostel\n'
              '   beforehand.  They all cost roughly $22\n'
              '   pricey for South America.  However, youre at the end of the '
              'world, so\n'
              '   this is logical.  Most are family-run, which is cool too.  '

              '   basically stay in someones house.\n'

              'that wicked\n'

              'Doite\n'
              '   sleeping bags, and even some jackets, I believe.  We paid '
              'roughly\n'
              '   $4\n'
              '   across the street from the government building.  Maps can be '
              'bought\n'
              '   there as well, and the couple that runs it is very, very '
              'nice.\n'
              '\n'
              '   3) There are very few restaurants in Puerto Williams, so be '
              'prepared to\n'
              '   cook.  There is a bar, which is located on the dock barge, '
              'where all of\n'
              '   the boats are parked.  Lots of round-the-world sailors are in '

              'and ties up\n'
              '   onto the roof. The view of Labé was like that of Kankan: a '

              '   The West African bush taxi is effectively a car, and the '
              'primary means\n'
              '   of transport for locals and travelers like.  Its called a '
              'bush taxi\n'
              '   because its often barreling through the bush, bumping along '
              'dirt roads\n'
              '   and tearing through village-land.  Typically, this car is a '
              'Peugot 504\n'
              '   station wagon, like the one pictured above.  However, it can '

              '   many vehicular forms.  When you want to move from place to '

              '\n'
              '   A bush taxi will take you almost anywhere you want to go.  '

              'truly in\n'
              '   the middle of nowhere, you will probably find a bush taxi to '
